### Task 3: QSVM

#### Problem Statement

Generate a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) using the iris dataset 
and try to propose a kernel from a parametric quantum circuit to classify 
the three classes(setosa, versicolor, virginica) using the one-vs-all format,
the kernel only works as binary classification. Identify the proposal with
the lowest number of qubits and depth to obtain higher accuracy. You can 
use the UUâ€  format or using the Swap-Test.

#### Solution

Please refer to the 'Task 3 submission' notebook.
